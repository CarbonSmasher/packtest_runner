# PackTest Runner
This is a simple tool to help with running the [PackTest](https://github.com/misode/packtest) Minecraft datapack testing framework. It will start a Fabric server in the `packtest_launch` directory with the PackTest mod loaded, then automatically run the tests in the packs you specify. It will return an exit code based on the success of the tests when finished.

## Usage

### Command line
`packtest_runner [OPTIONS...] <PACK1> [PACK2] [PACK3] ...`

#### Options
 - `--minecraft-version`: The Minecraft version to use. PackTest only supports 1.20.4, and this is the default.
 - `--comma-separate`: If set, will read the packs from the first argument specified, and split it by commas into multiple packs. Do not add spaces between the packs.
 - `--packtest-url`: The URL to use when downloading the PackTest jar.
 - `--github`: Shows extra messages in the output for GitHub actions to use.

### GitHub Actions
You can use this repository as a GitHub action step to test your datapack in your CI/CD pipeline.

#### Example (from [https://github.com/misode/packtest-runner-example]())
```yml
name: Run tests
